This is my noobie attempt to create my portfolio website. The design is inspired by Sean Halpin's website and i tried to recreate it. The website is made with HTML5 and CSS3. I have used Flexbox to create grids in my website and the project is under development. I plan to add lazy scrolling animations, update the dummy texts in the website, add a projects section and update all the dummy links with the real one.

Till then, you can view the website at: https://skcshubham.github.io/weirdportfolio 

As of now the website is partially mobile responsive. Kindly don't freak out when you open it on your mobile. :)
